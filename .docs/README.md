## 📚 Documentation Files

This directory contains all project documentation, specifications, and context that AI agents and developers can reference:

- **`rules.md`** - Complete teaching philosophy and AI interaction guidelines
- **`workspace-structure.md`** - Project structure, file organization, and conventions
- **`design.md`** - System architecture, design decisions, and implementation patterns

## 🎯 Purpose

This directory serves as the **single source of truth** for:
- Project architecture and design decisions
- Development guidelines and best practices
- AI assistant interaction patterns
- Project structure and conventions
- Current priorities and tasks

## 📖 For AI Agents

**Load these files on-demand**, not upfront. See `.ai/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for the loading strategy.

- Basic architecture principles are already in `.ai/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- Only load specific files when relevant to the current task
- Ask before loading: "Would it help if I review [file] for [reason]?"
